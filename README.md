# fsp-7-sem-py

Setting up code space to run the files as my VS keep crashing...

> The training program was scheduled from Monday to Saturday..
> 6 day course. total : 36 hr long.

Tried to solve all the questions except few where i was trying to solve the previous one... but then missed the current one. 

>[!note]
> some of the codes may not work as they are incomplete or VS crashed while i was trying to do that part... and i switched to some online python intepreter.

This folder includes bottom up and top down approach for many pages... notes aren't complete as i have been trying to code instead of writing everything down...
